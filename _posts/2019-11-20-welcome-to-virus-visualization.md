Welcome to my blog! I'm Viral and this site was created by me to take a deep dive into sports analytics. I look into data on a daily basis to maximize my fantasy lineups so I thought why not share some of the insights that I find. The goal of this site is for me to simply learn new tools and take a deep dive into sports analytics. Feel free to post or link this anywhere you see and if you have any questions please feel free to tweet @VirusViz anytime.
